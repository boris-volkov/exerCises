gcc -c geom_2d.c -fPIC -o 2d.o
-fPIC option is mandatory for shared libraries
PIC means position independent code
The addresses in these files are relative, not absolute like in static libraries

the shared library is an object file, and not just an archive like
a static library.

use these commands to make the file and put it in the right place: 

gcc -shared 2d.o 3d.o trigon.o -o libgeometry.so
mkdir -p /opt/geometry
mv libgeometry.so /opt/geometry

once you compile main.o using
gcc -c xxxxx.c -o main.o

link it with 
gcc main.o -L /opt/geometry -lgeometry -lm -o final.out

this file will still have errors running because the dynamic library is
not on the known path. you need to add it to the path by using

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/geometry
