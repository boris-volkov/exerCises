A static library is for creating an archive of a bunch of relocatable 
object files. 

once .o files are made for everything in the project, you can make 
the static library using the ar command

ar crs libgeometry.a trig.o 2d.o 3d.o

make a good directory for the library and move it there:

mkdir -p /opt/geometry
mv libgeometry.a /opt/geometry

to see the contents:

ar t /opt/geometry/libgeometry.a

putting it in the opt directory makes it easy for other programs to 
locate it.

gcc main.o -L /opt/geometry/ -lgeometry -lm -o final.out

the main which wants to use the shared library has to include the 
header file that makes the declarations, -L option tells gcc where 
to look for the library.
-lgeometry makes it look for something called libgeometry
-lm is for the math functions (?) glibm
